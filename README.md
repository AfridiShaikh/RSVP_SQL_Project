# RSVP_SQL_Project

-> I'm excited to be working on a strategic project with RSVP Movies, a renowned Indian film production company. 
   They're venturing into the global market with a new movie in 2022 and have entrusted me to provide analytical insights based on movie data from the past 3 years.

-> Using SQL, I'll dive into the dataset to extract valuable recommendations across four key segments, analyzing trends, audience preferences, and successful strategies. 
   This project aims to guide RSVP Movies towards a successful global debut, leveraging data-driven decision-making in the world of cinema.
